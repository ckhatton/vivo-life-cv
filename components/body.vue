        <h4 class="text-lg mb-2 text-green">Why do I want to work at Vivo Life?</h4>
        <p class="my-4">
          It’s exciting to be part of a forward thinking, green company, who value their employees as much as their product. It is a unique opportunity to work for a company who cares for the planet and is true to their mission. I also love MATCHA!
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-lg mb-2 text-green">What will I bring to Vivo Life?</h4>
        <p class="my-4">
          I have all the skills required for the job. Over the last 5 months I have helped build, update and maintain product, landing and account pages for the business; each grabbing the backend data of the Shopify store. I have 7 years commercial experience with Shopify Liquid, and I more recently code with Vue.js and Tailwind CSS, which are used to build the store. This is alongside my own freelance work building a variety of websites and email templates for companies and individuals.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          Overall, I have been working in the industry for 8 years covering all types of websites, from your simple HTML5 business card type lander to full Shopify themes from scratch, utilising techniques like Ajax and tools such as jQuery. I can also build web apps which can be tagged onto the website. All of which are built fully responsive with attention to detail.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          In the past I have built Ruby on Rails apps as Shopify plugins to extend the usability of the ecommerce platform. I now build apps using Node.js and Vue.js on which this site is running. This means I also have experience of creating and integrating APIs, such as REST.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          Throughout my career I have used Git as versioning control on Github and Bitbucket. This not only keeps a record of work, but it also allows others to contribute. To make sure that it is legible, I make sure to abide by clean programming practices.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          It is exciting to also know that the project methodology SCRUM has recently been introduced to Vivo Life. I studied this model of practise and have not seen it used in businesses I have previously been involved in.

          I have a BSc Honours in Computing and BA Honours in Design: Illustration. This means I have a trained designer’s eye that gives me the edge over other programmers who may struggle with frontend HCI. I was introduced to personal computers when I was six years old, and saw the introduction of the Internet with the dial-up modem. Having always had an appeal in computing and a drive to solve issues and problems I decided to do a computing degree, directly after completing the illustration degree. It was there that I really got to grips with web development and programming languages. I am confident and have vast experience in using the Adobe suite programs having built my own designs in the likes of Photoshop, Illustrator, and XD.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          I have been made a very welcome part of the Vivo Life team as a contractor. I would like to confirm my position and help drive the business to its full potential. A secure position with Vivo Life would mean I could be fully involved and not have to share my time with other clients.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-lg mt-4 mb-2 text-green">What about me?</h4>
        <p class="my-4">
          I am a dedicated, hard working, and honest individual. I am considerate of others and although I have dyslexia, I do not let that hinder me, it is the reason for my determination.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          Even though I spend a great deal of time in front of the computer, I do like to get outside for walks and cycling. I have a campervan which I enjoy taking for campouts. I also ride a motorbike that I love to cruise around on and I play a washboard! I also have a passion for growing chillies.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-lg mt-4 mb-2 text-green">And what a team!</h4>
        <p class="my-4">
          I have gotten to know the team and how things work at Vivo HQ, and it is a great working environment! Everyone is so positive, got great ideas and knows how to have fun.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          Coming from a mixed heritage background I appreciate the companies active recognition of Black Lives Matter and I have already been made to feel like a member of the team. By being in such a positive working environment and having a team that works so well together, I know I can bring more to the business and would love to join the crew!
